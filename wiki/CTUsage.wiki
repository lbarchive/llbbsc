    # for CT Widget
    # for being used in calling CT widget rendering function if not applicable to using CT as widget because your theme doesn't support it.

Each mode above may have the following citations providing methods:
  * Disable: By checking this to not show citations to visitors.
  * Automatic: By checking this to directly append citations right after post's content.
  * Manual: By checking this to allow visitors to get citation by a click.
    * Dynamic: If you also check this, after visitors clicking on "Cite this...", then the citations will be loaded in-page, not redirect to a citation-only page.
    * Popup: If you also check this, after visitors clicking on "(new window)", then brings up a new browser window with the citations.
