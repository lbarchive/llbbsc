# Introduction #

Many plugin users asked about why doesn't this plugin work. The reason could be various. Before you installing this plugin, it's better to ensure:
  * Your WordPress's version is the same as CT's developing environment. Check the `readme.txt` in the archive you downloaded.
  * You may need to use latest CT version, the problem you have may have been solved.

# First, Default and Classic Theme #

  * Please reset plugin's General Options and switch blog's theme to Default or Classic.
  * Go to the home page of you blog.
  * Is there a gray bar after each post?

If default or classic can work with CT, then you may need to [modify your theme](http://code.google.com/p/llbbsc/wiki/CTThemeModification).

# Default and Classic Theme can't work with CT #

Try to deactivate plugins other than CT. Does CT work now? If so, then you need to find out which plugin conflicts with CT and report to [this group](http://groups.google.com/group/llbbsc).

# Still not working #

Please try to read any errors in your web server's error log which generated right after you load a page of your blog. That page should have CT, for example your home page of blog.

Report the errors, WordPress version, PHP version, MySQL version to [this group](http://groups.google.com/group/llbbsc).
