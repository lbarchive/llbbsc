# Introduction #

This is a simple plugin for creating a new View for listing topics started a year or years ago on the same calendar date.

_Please also read **[this page](http://code.google.com/p/llbbsc/)** about Support, Discussion, etc_

## Demonstration ##

Unfortunately, my own bbPress forum is too young (less an a year), therefore I can't give you any demonstrations. If you have a bbPress forum more than a year and you use this plugin, please inform me with your forum. I may put a link for your forum.
